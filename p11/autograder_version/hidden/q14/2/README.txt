`all_planets_list` data structure is not used to answer

Ensure you are using `all_planets_list` to find
'GJ 674 b'. Iterate over it and compare the
`planet_name` attribute to identify the planet.
After finding the planet, use `break` to exit the
loop. Check your loop and `break` statement
implementation.
