incorrect comparison operator is used

The test checks the comparison operator for
excluding stars with density more than 25. Verify
your comparison operator to ensure it excludes the
correct values. Review your logic for computing
density and filtering by the threshold. Consider
testing with edge cases, such as density exactly
equal to 25.
