incorrect logic is used to answer

Check that your code correctly identifies all
planets orbiting 'GJ 9827'. Ensure that you are
matching planets to the star based on the correct
data fields. If you are modifying the data,
confirm your modifications are accurate. Utilize
the provided solution's structure and verify the
implementation of the mathematical operations for
the calculation of the ratio. Test your code with
different datasets to ensure its robustness.
