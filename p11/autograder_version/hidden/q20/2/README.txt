`get_surface_gravity`, `get_distances_to_star`, `get_liquid_water_distances`, and `get_surface_temperatures` functions are not used to answer

Ensure you are using `get_surface_gravity`,
`get_distances_to_star`,
`get_liquid_water_distances`, and
`get_surface_temperatures` functions correctly to
compute the criteria for habitable planets. If
these functions are not called or implemented as
expected, check function definitions and their
usage in your code.
