`broken_data` data structure is not used to answer

The test checks whether `all_planets_list`
correctly includes `Planet` objects from
`planets_list` and the files in `broken_data`.
Ensure your loop iterates over the paths in
`broken_data` and that `get_planets` is called
with the correct arguments. Use `extend` to add to
`all_planets_list`. Avoid altering `planets_list`.
