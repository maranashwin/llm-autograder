`planets_list` data structure is modified or redefined

The test checks if `planets_list` is correct, or
is modified after your code runs. Ensure that 
(1) your computation of `planets_list` is correct;
(2) in your implementation, `planets_list` is not
altered. Copy its contents to `all_planets_list`
without affecting the original `planets_list`. Use
`extend` method carefully to avoid unintended
modifications.
