incorrect logic is used to answer

Ensure that your code correctly computes the
coefficient of variance using the standard
deviation and mean of the list `ratios_gj9827`.
Review your implementation for any possible
logical errors. To troubleshoot, verify if you are
correctly handling import statements and using the
`stdev` and `mean` functions from the `statistics`
module as intended. Double-check your calculations
to ensure accurate results with modified datasets.
