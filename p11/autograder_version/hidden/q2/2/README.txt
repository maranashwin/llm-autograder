recomputed variable defined in Question 1

The test checks if you reused the variable
`ratios_gj9827` correctly, without redefining or
recomputing it after Question 1. Verify that your
solution uses this variable directly when
calculating the coefficient of variance. Ensure
that your import statement for the `statistics`
module is correct and that you are calling the
`stdev` and `mean` functions properly on the
`ratios_gj9827` list. If the list contains
negative numbers, the standard deviation and mean
calculations will still be valid, but the nature
of the data might affect the coefficient of
variance. Make sure to handle any list data type
effectively.
