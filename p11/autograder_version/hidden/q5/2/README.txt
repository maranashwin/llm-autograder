`planets_list` data structure is not used to answer

Check that you're using the `planets_list` data
structure provided in the course materials. Ensure
your code filters out planets with missing data
and properly excludes planets with
`insolation_flux` over 7000. Use list
comprehensions or loops to create the required
lists for plotting.
