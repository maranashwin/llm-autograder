answer does not check for only files that start with `stars`

This test examines whether your code correctly
identifies and filters files starting with 'stars'
in the 'data' directory. The dataset has been
modified to include additional files which start
with substrings of 'stars'. This modification aims
to check whether your code is carefully
distinguishing files whose names start
specifically with 'stars', not merely a substring
of it.
