recomputed variable defined in Question 1 or Question 2, or the answer is not sorted explicitly

This test verifies if your
solution uses the pre-computed and preprocessed
variable `files_in_data` from the previous
question and doesn't recompute it in the process.
It also checks if your answer is correctly sorted.
To evaluate this, a piece of code is injected that
modifies the `files_in_data` variable.
