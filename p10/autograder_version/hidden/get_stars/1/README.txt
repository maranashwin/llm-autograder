function logic is incorrect

This test is checking if your `get_stars` function
is implemented correctly. Your function should
take a file path as input, read the data from the
CSV file, and return a dictionary mapping the star
name to a `Star` object containing all the details
of the star. To test your function, it is being
called with different inputs and the output is
compared to the expected output. Make sure your
function returns the correct dictionary for all
possible inputs.
