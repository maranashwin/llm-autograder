answer does not check for only stars that start with `Kepler`

You need to calculate the average stellar age of
stars whose names start with "Kepler". Make sure
to skip stars with missing stellar age data. Be
careful, there are some stars whose names have
"Kepler" appearing somewhere in the name, but they
should not be included in the calculation. The
dataset has been modified with changes to the
"Star Name" column.
