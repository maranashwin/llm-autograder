incorrect logic is used to answer

You need to find the average Stellar Age
of all stars whose names begin with 'Kepler'. 
There might be some logical errors in your code 
that could prevent you from getting the correct 
answer. To test this, we will use a different 
dataset where everything is different. If your 
code fails to find the average age of stars in
this new dataset, it suggests there are logical 
errors in your code. Make sure to handle
missing data properly and implement the correct
logic to find the average age.
