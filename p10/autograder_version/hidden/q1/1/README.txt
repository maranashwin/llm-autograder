answer is not sorted explicitly

This test checks if your solution
correctly implements sorting. It ensures that the
answer remains consistent even if the comparison
behavior for strings is modified in a certain way.
By adapting the sorting process of given elements,
the test confirms that you explicitly
sorted the list, rather than relying on a specific
default behavior.
