data structure is defined incorrectly

This test is checking if you have correctly
defined the data structure that contains the list
of planets with their details. It is important that you
define this data structure correctly by parsing all five
files, as any errors here will affect all future 
questions as  well. Make sure that you use `try/except`
to identify the JSON file with the missing data and
skip it. The test will compare your data structure
against the correct one to see if they match. Make
sure you have followed the instructions and
defined the data structure correctly.
