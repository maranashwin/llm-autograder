`mapping_1_json` data structure is not used to answer

You need to use the `mapping_1_json` data structure
to access the `host_name` of the fifth star. The
dictionary already contains the `host_name` data about
all planets in `planets_1.csv`. Make sure to use the data
from the `mapping_1_json` dictionary to answer the
question. A modified version of the dictionary is
provided right before the answer to this question.
If your answer does not use this modified data
structure, you may not have used the data
correctly.
