`stars_paths` is not used to find paths of necessary files

The test is checking if the variable `stars_paths`
is correctly used to find the necessary file
paths. A code injection is performed that
redefines the `stars_paths` variable to contain a
different set of files. If the original files are
still read despite this injection, it suggests
that the `stars_paths` variable was not used to
answer the question.
