boolean values are not typecasted correctly

The test is checking if your code correctly
typecasts boolean values. The dataset has been
modified and some values in the `Controversial
Flag` column have been changed. Around half of the
values are now set to 0 and the other half to 1.
Make sure your code correctly interprets these
values and returns the corresponding boolean
values.
