function logic is incorrect

The test is evaluating the
'planet_cell' function implementation which you have
written. It specifically checks whether the
function correctly extracts values from the list
of lists 'planets_rows' given the row index and
column name. The test will verify if the function
accurately handles missing values and typecasts
different values based on the column name. The
test will run the function on a variety of
possible inputs.
