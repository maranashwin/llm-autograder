paths are hardcoded using slashes

The test is checking for the
robustness of your code across different operating
systems. If paths have been hardcoded using "/" or
"\\", the code may fail on some systems. The code
injection is carrying out alterations to evaluate
whether your code can function correctly in
different operating system environments.
Therefore, ensure that you're using `os.path.join`
instead of hardcoding slashes.
