answer does not check only for files that end with `.csv`

In this test, we examined whether
your code properly identifies only files that end
with the ".csv" extension as CSV files. To do so,
we added additional files to the dataset with
extension endings in "csv". Make sure you are
checking not just for "csv" in the string, but
specifically for ".csv" at the end of the file's
name.
