incorrect logic is used to answer

Find the average planet radius of planets that
orbit stars with stellar radius more than 10 times
the radius of the Sun. Be careful, there are some
missing data. The dataset has been modified to
test your code. Some stellar radius values are
missing and for some stars with high stellar
radius, the planet radius data is missing or zero.
Double-check your logic to ensure correct results
despite these modifications.
