incorrect comparison operator is used

The test is checking if you are correctly
comparing the stellar radius of stars. The dataset
has been modified to have many stars with a
stellar radius just above the threshold. This is
to catch cases where you are using the wrong
comparison operator. Make sure you are comparing
the stellar radius of stars correctly by using the
correct comparison operator.
