data structure is defined more than once

This test is checking if you have defined your
namedtuple class multiple times. Try to ensure you
define your classes where you are asked to,
and not inside functions, which could result in
the class being redefined every time the function
is called. This could lead to unnecessary
performance issues and possible conflicts if
definitions don't align.
