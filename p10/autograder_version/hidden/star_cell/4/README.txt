function is defined more than once

This test is designed to ensure that your function
'star_cell' is defined only once in your notebook.
Having multiple definitions can lead to unexpected
results if notebook cells are executed out of
order. The test reads through your code and counts
definitions of the function 'star_cell'. It may
fail if more than one definition is found. Please
ensure your function is defined only once.
