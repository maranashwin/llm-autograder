incorrect logic is used to answer

The test is checking if your code can correctly
find the youngest star and the planets that orbit
it. The test modifies the dataset to have completely
different stars and planets, so if your code fails
to find the youngest star and its orbiting
planets, it suggests that there is a logical error
in your code. Make sure to review your logic and
consider edge cases.
