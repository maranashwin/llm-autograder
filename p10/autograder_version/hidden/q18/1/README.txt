`planets_list` and `stars_dict` data structures are not used to answer

You need to access the `Planet` objects in the 
`planets_list` list and `Star` objects in the
`stars_dict` dictionary. These data structures 
already contain all the data about the planets
and stars in  the dataset. Make sure to use the 
data from the `planets_list` list and `stars_dict`
dictionary to answer the question. A modified 
version of the list and dictionary are provided 
right before the answer to this question.
If your answer does not use these modified data
structures, you may not have used the data
correctly.
