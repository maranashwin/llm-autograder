did not exit loop and instead iterated further after finding the answer

Your code is searching for the Star object that
corresponds to a specific Planet object. Make sure
that your code correctly identifies the Planet
object with the given name, and then uses the
host_name attribute to find the corresponding Star
object. Remember that you do not need to continue
looping through the list of planets once you have
found the required planet. The dataset is modified
and other Planet objects with the same name but
different hosts are added to the dataset.
