This test is checking if your code correctly
counts the number of planets that were discovered
in the year 2023. We have modified the dataset to
include planets with different discovery years.
Some planets have the discovery year set to 2023,
while others have it set to 2022 or 2024. Make
sure your code accurately identifies the planets
that were discovered in 2023. Remember to output
your answer as an integer.
