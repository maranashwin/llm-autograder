incorrect logic is used to answer

The code is attempting to find the number
of planets discovered in 2023. To test if your 
code is correctly identifying these planets, 
we have modified the dataset completely. 
Make sure your code is not just relying 
on specific values in the original dataset, 
but instead is correctly identifying planets 
discovered in 2023.
