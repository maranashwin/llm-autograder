`planets_list` data structure is not used to answer

You need to access the `Planet` objects in the 
`planets_list` list. The list already 
contains all the data about the planets in 
the dataset. Make sure to use the data
from the `planets_list` list to answer the
question. A modified version of the list is
provided right before the answer to this question.
If your answer does not use this modified data
structure, you may not have used the data
correctly.
