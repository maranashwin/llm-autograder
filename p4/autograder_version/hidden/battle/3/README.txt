function output is incorrect when one or more of the Pokemon cannot damage the other

The test indicated that your `battle` function
might not handle scenarios where one Pokemon
cannot damage another correctly. Verify your
implementation to ensure that it gracefully
addresses cases with 'infinitely many' hits and
compares the hits required by each Pokemon
accurately, taking into account their speed when
necessary.
