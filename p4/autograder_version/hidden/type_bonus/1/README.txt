function output is incorrect when the `defender` has only one type

Check if your function correctly handles cases
where the `defender` has only one type. Ensure
that it correctly uses the `project.get_type1()`
and does not apply a second type multiplier if
`defender_type2` is `'DNE'`. Review for logic
errors that could misinterpret a single-type
defender.
