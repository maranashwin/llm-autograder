function output is incorrect when the `defender` has two types

Check if your function correctly handles cases
where the `defender` has two types. Ensure
that it correctly uses the `project.get_type1()`
and applies a second type multiplier if
`defender_type2` is not `'DNE'`. Review for logic
errors that could misinterpret a dual-type
defender.
